# Raspberry Pi Camera GUI
A GUI for the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera (still in its early stages)

Feel free to help contribute!

Current setup:

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera
* Pimoroni Hyperpixel 4.0" Touch Display
* Battery pack
* Pimoroni button shim


Build tutorial with 3D prints will be added later, once the hardware is finialized.


I will update the repository again once I get the button shim set up (waiting for shipping).
