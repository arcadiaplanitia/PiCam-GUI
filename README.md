# Raspberry Pi Camera GUI
A GUI for the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera (still in its early stages)

Feel free to help contribute!

Current setup:

Raspberry Pi Zero W

Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera

Pimoroni Hyperpixel 4.0" Touch Display

Battery pack

Pimoroni button shim


Build tutorial with 3D prints will be added later, once the hardware is finialized.


The button shim is now necessary since the touch GUI is not really possible with the PiCamera library.

I will update the repository again once I get the button shim set up.
